# Food_ie_Food

This food shopping app for ordring delicious food

- user can order food
- add and remove item from cart
- place order
- All data stored into Mongo Data base
  I am **new to Backend** for that i took help from internet.
  Even this is my first app as Full-Stack with MERN stack and building API for different endpoint

## Tool I used

**Clent side**

- Javascript
- React.js
- React-router-dom
- HTML
- CSS

**server side**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- mongoose
- body-parser
- dotenv
- nodemon

## Resource I use

- Stackoverflow
- Google
- Youtube Videos to learn Backend(Just fair idea how it work)

## Challenge I faced

First of all I enjoy working on this project as Full Stack

- I have skill regarding Front end so deficult to get hang of Backend Like MongDB, Express, Node.js
- But in all common point was Javascript, So feel familer little bit
- On every stage I have lot of bugs to fix which i was not aware of But manage to solve with google/stackoverflow/Youtube
- also I have limited Internet pack which burnout after watching some videos

## What can be done

- As I said this was my first Full Stack App with MERN stack which mean lot more scope for change
  `Like`
- signin/ signup
- order detail with shipping address, payment, delivery and more..
- Filter based on price/ brand / rating / category etc..
  `Most importtant I enjoy working on this project`
